# setpaths-cli
A CLI command to set folder structures for development.

Clone this to a custom folder.

Execute this by entering 'node ${path}/setpaths'. 

Or you can make this global in /usr/local/bin/ by copying to that path with 'cp' command and make it executable with 'sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/setpaths'
