# setpaths-cli
A CLI command to set folder structures for development.

Clone this to a custom folder.

Execute this by entering 'node ${path-to-this-folder}/setpaths'. 

Or you can make this global in '/usr/local/bin/' by copying that file with 'cp' 
command and make it executable with 'sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/setpaths'

You can also make this available globally by entering ```npm link``` 
and just pass in 'setpaths createfolder' in your terminal.

Customise your folder structure and paths in the fullPaths object as you'd like.

## Requirements:
Node
MacOS or Linux
